# SlashTags
YouTube introduced the ability to write up to 3 tags in a video description. These appear above the title of videos.

Most tag tools recommend regular tags.
This script extracts tags from descriptions of videos that match a keyword.
The tags are normalised and tallied in a dictionary. They are sorted by frequency, however, a method of deciding the popularity of videos to weigh tags is being considered.
